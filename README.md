## About This Project
This repository is my submission for the BeyondChats internship assignment.

I am currently learning full stack development and backend concepts. This assignment helped me understand how real-world applications are structured and how APIs, databases, and frontend work together.

I have approached this task step by step and focused on learning and implementing the basics clearly.

## Assignment Progress

### Phase 1: Backend (Scraping & APIs)
Status: Partially Completed

- Goal was to scrape the oldest blog articles from BeyondChats and store them in a database.
- Backend setup using Node.js and Express is planned.
- CRUD APIs for articles are being worked on.
- Basic understanding of scraping using Axios and Cheerio was explored.

### Phase 2: Article Update using AI
Status: Not Implemented

- This phase involves Google search, content scraping, and rewriting articles using an LLM.
- Due to limited time and my beginner level in backend automation, this phase is not implemented.
- The overall idea and flow are understood and planned for future improvement.

### Phase 3: Frontend (React)
Status: Started (Placeholder)

- Created frontend folder with App.js as a placeholder.
- Will fetch articles from backend APIs and display title & content in a clean layout.
- Focus is on basic structure; styling and functionality will be added in future.

## Notes
This project reflects my current learning stage. I focused on understanding concepts clearly rather than copying advanced solutions. I am motivated to improve my skills and build more complete applications with guidance and practice.
